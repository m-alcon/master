\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

In this project, we developed a MNB classifier in \textit{Python 3}, following the algorithm described in section \ref{sec:algorithm}. As we mentioned before, the algorithm is divided in two functions. The \textbf{\textit{fit}} function needs the input data (an array of observations) and a set of classes. Each observation must contain one and only one class within it. If the set of classes is not passed as an input to the function, it will assume that the class of the observation is in its first position. In the case of \textbf{\textit{predict}}, it just needs an array of occurrences that it has to predict. It outputs an array of the predicted classes corresponding to each of the occurrences.
