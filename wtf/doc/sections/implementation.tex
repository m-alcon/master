\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

All the experiments were programmed with Python 3. We used the well-know \textit{scikit-kearn} Python package to apply the classifier methods, cross-validation, train and test split, etc. 

Feature elimination was implemented by ourselves. For the selection of the features, the methodology that we used is the following: for one classifier method and for each possible feature, we delete the feature from both training and testing data, we train the model, we predict the testing instances, and finally we compute the accuracy of the model. If this accuracy is greater than the one obtained without deleting the feature, we consider that it is not relevant, so it can be permanently removed.

For more details of the implementation you can always take a look to the Python script that we developed.
