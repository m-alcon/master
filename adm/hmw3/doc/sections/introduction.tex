\section{Introduction}
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier (MNB) is part of the family of the Naive Bayes classifiers, which are simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes's theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

The main characteristic of MNB is that it works with transactional data. This means that each observation of the data is seen as a data structure itself, so it can contain different number of features (items) in each of them.

The goal of MNB is: given a set of observations of different classes and sizes, each of them formed by several items, create a model (conditional probabilities of the instances given the class, and the probabilities of the classes themselves) in order to predict the class of other observations.
