    The increasing amount of data collected in whatever field leads to Data Mining and Machine Learning to increase its importance in our lives. Because of that, we want to use this data to impact directly in the most important aspect of people's lives: health. In this work, we focus on the detection of the degree of presence of heart disease in a patient. We try different classifier methods to predict it using the well-known Hearth Disease data set \cite{dataset} of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
