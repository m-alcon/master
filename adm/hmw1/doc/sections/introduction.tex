\section{Introduction}
The importance of Data Mining and Machine Learning in science fields like medicine is increasing. Medical data about the patient allow us, the computer scientists, to give relevant information about him or her to the doctor, and even predict some diseases.

Because this is one of our first works related to Data Mining and Medicine, we want to take a first experience on it. So, we want to build a process that, using the Heart Disease data set, predicts the degree of presence of heart disease in the patient.

To be more precise, the main objective of our work is to achieve the best possible accuracy over the Heart Disease data set, with a restricted number of classifier methods, which are Naive Bayes (NB), Nearest Neighbors (NN), Decision Trees (DT) and Super Vector Machines (SVM). We selected these classifiers due to its relevance and renown.
