\section{Introduction}
Clustering algorithms are really relevant in the scientific community. They are used in several fields like biology, medicine, business and marketing, computer science, etc.

Because of that, we want to analyze and compare two of the most well-known algorithms in cluster analysis, which are Expectation-maximization (EM) and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). We chose both algorithms because they have really different ideas behind its implementation, so we expect that they are significantly different to be compared.

To be more precise, the main objective of our work is to apply different datasets to both algorithms, analyze the results and their differences to select a winner, if possible.
