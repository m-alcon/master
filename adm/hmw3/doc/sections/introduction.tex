\section{Introduction}
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier (MNB) is part of the family of the Naive Bayes classifiers, which are simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes's theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

The main characteristic of MNB is that it works with transactional data. This means that each observation of the data is seen as a data structure itself, so it can contain different number of features (items) in each of them. 

The goal of MNB is
