\section{Conclusions}
% Analyzing the behavior of four classifier methods applied to the Heart Disease data set, starting from a classification process composed only by one classifier with at most 0.617 accuracy (with SVM), we developed a whole process divided in three different stages, explained in section \ref{sec:experimentation}, which involves feature elimination, different labeling of the target values, two different classifiers, and a fusion process to obtain the final accuracy. The best accuracy that we achieve is 0.7, increasing by almost 0.1 the starting accuracy.

% As future work, we could perform the same experimentation but with other classifiers. Moreover, we could try the feature elimination of the last experiment with all possible combinations of the classifiers, including new ones.
