\section{Importance}
A \textit{SIFT} descriptor is a 128-dimensional vector normalized to length one. It characterizes a local image patch by capturing local gradients into a set of histograms which are then compacted into one descriptor vector. A query usually involves finding the best matched descriptor vector(s) in the database to a SIFT descriptor extracted from a query image. Matching image descriptors for an application like image recognition must be fast. Hence, increasing the speed of the query is very important in the \textit{CV} (Computer Vision) field. 

However, this improvement is not only relevant in \textit{CV}, since, at the end, the authors are trying to increase the speed of searching $k$-dimensional points within some dataset using \textit{KD-trees}. As it is seen in the paper, this data structure performs really good in this domain, which is not a surprise since is a well-known space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a $k$-dimensional space.
