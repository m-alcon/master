\section{Importance}
Matching image descriptors for an application like image recognition must be fast. So, increasing the speed of the query is really important in the \textit{CV} (Computer Vision) field and the other ones that take advantage of it (like robotics). 

However, this improvement is not only relevant in \textit{CV}, since, at the end, the authors are trying to increase the speed of searching $k$-dimensional points within some dataset using \textit{KD-trees}. As it is seen in the paper, this data structure performs really good in matching image descriptors quickly, which is not a surprise since it is a well-known space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a $k$-dimensional space.
