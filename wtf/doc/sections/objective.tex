\section{Objectives}
The main objective of our work is to achieve the best possible accuracy with a restricted number of classifier methods, which are Naive Bayes (NB), Nearest Neighbors (NN), Decision Trees (DT) and Super Vector Machines (SVM). We select these classifiers due to its relevance and renown.
