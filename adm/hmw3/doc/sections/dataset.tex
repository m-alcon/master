\section{Data}

After we have implemented the algorithm, we have to test its correctness and behavior. To do the first, we applied it with the \textit{toy} example of \cite{slides} as the input, and we compared the result of our classifier with the expected one. To test its behavior in a more realistic case, we also applied our MNB to the \textit{markbask} data set. It is composed by a list of observations, each of them composed by supermarket products, the gender of the purchaser and the information of whether he/she owns a house or not (which are two possible classes of the observation).
