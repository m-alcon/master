\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

% All the experiments were programmed with Python 3. We used the well-know \textit{scikit-kearn} \cite{scikit-learn} Python package to apply the clustering methods and to calculate their accuracy (with the adjusted random score), and \textit{matplotlib} \cite{matplotlib} to create the plots of the first and second experiments. 

% For more details of the implementation, you can always take a look at the Python script that we developed (inside \textit{`src'} folder).
