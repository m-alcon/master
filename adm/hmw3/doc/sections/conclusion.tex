\section{Conclusions}
We have achieved the objectives that we had for this project: understand MNB, implement it successfully, and test it. As a result of the experimentation, we can conclude that the accuracy of the classifier is not so much high, but at least is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. This means that, even predicting the gender of a person or house ownership by a small set of products that he/she buys in the supermarket, which is hard, the classifier can recognize some patterns in the data, and predict most of the times the correct class.

As future work, we could make a further testing of our implementation of MNB, with bigger and more realistic (complex) data sets.
